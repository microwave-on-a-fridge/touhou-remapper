# Touhou Remapper
A remapper for Touhou games made with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com). Remaps everything to WASD HJK and LShift.

It supports all Touhou shmup control schemes (that uses arrow keys) including [POFV's multiplayer controls](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Gameplay#Controls).

## Usage
Grab an executable release from the [releases](https://github.com/microwave-on-a-fridge/touhou-remapper/releases/latest) tab. You can also download the AHK script (with the icons!) from the source.

The remaps can be turned on by the context menu or the GUI. Just right click on the tray icon.
